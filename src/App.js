// 2 rules of component creations
// 1. Component must start with a capital letter
// 2. Must return a only one jsx element

// in normal js is orgument for react used to props (properties)

// Hooks -> React will listen to changes
// hooks is a function - start with  'use'
// State is define -> current value.
// setState -> change the state(setstate -> function)
// Intial value -> state intial value

// function Counter(){
//   // let like = 10;
//   const [like,setLike] =useState(0);
